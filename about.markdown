Thanks for landing here.
I am hoping that the reflections from this blog will help me become a 10x engineer.

And what exactly is 10x data engineer?
Not writing 10x lines of code or producing 10x more commits.

- Product mindset: solve real challenges that matter the most
- Problem solving & enabling others: Find the best solution quickly
- Technical expertise: make the most out of the frameworks and tools
