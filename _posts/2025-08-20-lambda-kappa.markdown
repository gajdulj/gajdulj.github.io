What are the common data processing architectures and what are the pros and cons of each?

## Lambda Architecture

Lambda architecture starts with a messaging layer where stream data is queued for processing. Often uses Kafka as a messaging layer.

The data flow is then split into two parallel paths:
- **Batch layer** - handles data in files or other batch processes
- **Streaming layer** (also known as speed layer) - can be consumed instantly with an API

Both layers then land in a serving layer (often a data warehouse) where analytics processes can access the data.

### Lambda Architecture Flow

**Data Processing Steps:**
1. **Data Sources** → Kafka/Messaging Layer
2. **Data Split** → Two parallel paths:
   - **Batch Layer**: For historical data
   - **Speed Layer**: For real-time data
3. **Merge Results** → Serving Layer (Data Warehouse)
4. **Final Output** → Analytics & Queries

### Advantages:
- Can use batch processing for reliable, comprehensive data processing
- Can use streaming only when needed for real-time requirements
- Enables fast access when needed but keeps the reliability of batch processing
- Batch process can do thorough validation and cleaning

### Disadvantages:
- **Complexity**: Need to maintain two separate processing pipelines
- **Timing challenges**: Data timing is more difficult to manage as some processes run daily and others in real-time
- **Data consistency**: Potential for discrepancies between batch and streaming results

## Kappa Architecture

In Kappa architecture, the message layer coordinates everything. All data gets passed through the speed layer as it's received and lands directly in a serving layer.

### Kappa Architecture Flow

**Data Processing Steps:**
1. **Data Sources** → Kafka/Messaging Layer
2. **Single Stream** → Speed Layer (Stream Processing)
3. **Real-time Processing** → Serving Layer (Data Warehouse)
4. **Final Output** → Analytics & Queries

**Historical Data Handling:**
- Historical Data → Replay from Kafka → Speed Layer

### Advantages:
- **Fast processing**: Everything is handled in real-time
- **Simpler architecture**: Fewer components to maintain and debug
- **Consistency**: Single processing path eliminates data discrepancies
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale a single processing pipeline

### Disadvantages:
- **Implementation challenges**: Difficult to achieve when files are used to transfer data
- **Legacy compatibility**: Legacy systems often can't stream data
- **Historical data**: Requires replay capabilities from message queue for historical analysis

## When to Use Each Architecture

**Choose Kappa if:**
- All your data sources can stream data
- You need real-time processing for all use cases
- You want a simpler, more maintainable architecture

**Choose Lambda if:**
- You have batch data sources that can't stream
- You need the reliability and thoroughness of batch processing
- You're dealing with legacy systems that require batch processing
