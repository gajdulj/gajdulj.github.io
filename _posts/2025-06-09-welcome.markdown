Thanks for landing here.

This blog is going to document my journey on becoming 10x data engineer.

A short summary on how I got where I am now.

I studied economics with a desire to get into the world of big finances.
After a finance analyst internship at Mastercard, I realised that I want to do something else.

- The idea of staring at Excel sheets was not appealing. 😵‍💫
- The urge to build something meaningful was stronger. 🛠️

I started to learn Python which I used to automate reporting at work. 🐍
I toyed around with few projects- not good engineering but I was learning.
Automating browser game from the childhood was fun.

At the time the idea of putting something bigger together was not in sight.

I channeled my energy and made decisions to build experience in the world of Data- including analytics, engineering and data science. 📊
Almost **8 years, 3 companies and 12+ larger projects later**, I felt a desire to document my journey and reflections. 

I am hoping to solidify my knowledge and share my learnings. In the writing I am planning to **focus on the fundamentals**- so knowing specific tools is not the goal.

tl;dr:
finance -> data analytics -> data engineering & data science -> data engineering consulting

And what exactly is my goal of becoming 10x data engineer?
Not writing 10x lines of code or producing 10x more commits.

- Product mindset: solve real challenges that matter the most
- Problem solving: Be able to find the best solution quickly
- Technical expertise: make the most out of the frameworks and tools
