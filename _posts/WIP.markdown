1. Shiny Object Syndrome

In Data Engineering, there are so many tools to choose from. This brings up the danger of **Shiny Object Syndrome**.
We collect new technologies and tools like badges. We always feel that we are missing something.
I was also a victim of this- trying to go through as many courses, libraries and frameworks as possible.


After some time, I think the most important thing is to focus on the fundamentals.
Getting the right thing done is the most important thing- so it's better to have a poor solution to a well defined problem than a perfect solution to a misunderstood problem.

Most people don't care about the tools you use, only the results you deliver.

Shiny Object Syndrome:
- Focus on the big picture: why we are solving the problem?
- Work from the end: what will a successful delivery look like? -> MVP
- “Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler”
- Fundamentals > hype
